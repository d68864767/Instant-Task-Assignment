# Test and Refine

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to test and refine your Zapier automation to ensure that it works correctly and efficiently.

## Step 1: Test Your Automation

1. **Press Your Button:** Press your IoT button or virtual button to trigger the automation. 

2. **Check Your Project Management Tool:** Log in to your project management tool and check whether a new task has been created in the specified project or board. The task should have the correct title and description, and it should be assigned to the correct team member.

3. **Check Your Notifications:** If you've set up notifications, check whether a notification has been sent to the assigned team member. The notification should contain the correct information about the new task.

## Step 2: Refine Your Automation

If your automation doesn't work as expected, or if you think it could work more efficiently, consider the following refinement steps:

1. **Button Configuration:** If pressing your button doesn't trigger the automation, refer to the `button_config.md` file and ensure that your button is correctly configured.

2. **Zapier Trigger:** If your Zapier trigger doesn't initiate the automation, refer to the `zapier_trigger_config.md` file and ensure that your trigger is correctly set up.

3. **Task Creation:** If a new task isn't created in your project management tool, or if the task details aren't correct, refer to the `task_creation_config.md` file and ensure that your task creation action is correctly set up.

4. **Assignment Logic:** If the task isn't assigned to the correct team member, refer to the `assignment_logic.js` file and ensure that your assignment logic is correctly implemented.

5. **Notifications:** If a notification isn't sent to the assigned team member, or if the notification doesn't contain the correct information, refer to the `notification_config.md` file and ensure that your notification action is correctly set up.

Remember, the goal of this automation is to enhance productivity and ensure that no good idea or urgent task gets overlooked. Therefore, it's worth spending some time to test and refine your automation until it works perfectly.
