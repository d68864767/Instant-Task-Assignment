# Button Configuration

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to configure your IoT button or virtual button application to trigger a Zapier automation.

## Physical IoT Button

If you're using a physical IoT button like Flic, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Button:** Follow the manufacturer's instructions to set up your button. This usually involves installing an app on your smartphone and pairing the button with the app.

2. **Connect to Zapier:** In the button's app, find the option to connect to Zapier. This will usually involve generating a webhook URL in Zapier and pasting it into the app.

3. **Configure the Button Press:** In the button's app, set the button press to trigger the webhook URL. You can usually choose between different types of presses (e.g., single press, double press, long press) to trigger different Zaps.

## Virtual Button Application

If you're using a virtual button application, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Button:** Follow the app's instructions to set up your button. This usually involves creating a new button and choosing an icon for it.

2. **Connect to Zapier:** In the app, find the option to connect to Zapier. This will usually involve generating a webhook URL in Zapier and pasting it into the app.

3. **Configure the Button Press:** In the app, set the button press to trigger the webhook URL.

Remember to test your button to ensure it triggers the Zapier automation correctly.
